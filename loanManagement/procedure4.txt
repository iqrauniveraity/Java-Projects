Verify Income Sources

Probably the most important step is to verify all the income, assets, and employment information of the borrower. You need to verify
 the employment of the borrower (VOE). You need to verify the income of the borrower (VOI). You also need to verify the assets listed
 by the borrower (VOA) and any other income information required or produced by the borrower. 

Every lender differs in the way you go about verifying a loan applicant's income, so be sure to follow the procedures for your specific
 lender. If your lender requires verification of employment in writing, you'll need to request that letter from the loan applicant's 
employer. For some lenders, paystubs and W2 forms are sufficient. And yet for others, simple verbal verification of employment by phone
 is fine. You need to record each verification that you have made into the loan processing software which you are using.
