 Loan File Review

If there are any mistakes, errors, or oversights, this is where they need to be caught. At this point, the loan process is complete; 
you have obtained the credit reports for the loan applicant. You have verified all income, deposits, and employment. You have 
appraised and inspected the property, the vehicle, or other asset, if needed. Now you need to check and re-check all of this 
documentation. If any of the information seems vague, you either need to clarify the information or write in an explanation as
 to why this information isn't provided in greater detail. This is also where you'll be able to find any red flags in the file. 
Be sure to highlight or note any red flags that you see before you send it off to the underwriters.
