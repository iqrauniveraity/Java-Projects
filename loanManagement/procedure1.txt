 The Loan File

The loan file is where it all begins. Depending on whether or not you are the loan processor of a larger company or both the loan officer
and loan processor of a smaller office, the work of the loan processor starts here with this file (well folder). The loan file will 
contain--you guessed it--the loan application. In addition, it will include comments made by anyone who has had their input in the 
loan application process as well as any notes about the potential borrower that was made during the loan interview process. 
Read through the application, comments, notes, and overall loan request. You should make sure that you understand the loan 
in its entirety before moving forward. If you have any questions about the loan you need to clarify these issues with the
 Loan Officer before moving forward. 

After you have reviewed the information and have a clear picture of the loan and why the applicant is requesting it, you'll enter this
information into your company's loan processing computer system. There are many programs out there that your employer will use; many 
of them are a combination of home-grown software packages. However, the reason this information needs to be fully entered into the 
computer system is because fulfilling all the requirements of a successful loan is tedious and deadline specific. The loan processing
 software you use will keep you on track for the next steps that need to be completed as well as their related deadlines. Once this 
information has been fully entered into the computer system, you can now proceed to the next step.
