 Certify and Deliver the File

Now that you have reviewed all the information in the loan file and are satisfied with the documentation you have provided and verified,
you will now finalize the loan package and deliver it to the lender, underwriter, and manager. 

In summary, your file should include the loan application, this is the typed and signed application with all information provided by 
the loan applicant, the credit report, all verifications of employment, income, assets (W2s, paystubs, tax returns, and bank statements, 
for instance), any valuation reports (inspections, appraisals, proof of insurance), any title reports (particularly noting any liens), 
and any public legal disclosures that must be signed by the loan applicant. The final product should be sent registered mail to the 
appropriate parties (most likely the lender or the underwriter).
