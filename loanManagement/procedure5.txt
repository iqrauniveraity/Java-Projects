Appraisals, Insurances, and Inspections 

If you have verified all the income and employment sources for the loan applicant (or you are far along in the process and you are only
 waiting for replies from the necessary parties), you are now ready to continue with any necessary appraisals, proof of insurance, or 
inspections. These items will vary greatly depending on the state and local laws that govern the loan which the applicant is requesting,
 as well as the type of loan itself. For example, if you are handling a mortgage loan, you'll need to have the property appraised, 
inspected, get proof that there is no termite presence (in some states), and other procedures.
