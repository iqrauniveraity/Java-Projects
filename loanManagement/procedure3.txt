 Title Records and Information

If you are processing a loan request for an automobile, boat, house, and so on, you will need to verify the title information
 (VOT: Verification of Title). This will not be necessary for all loans which you might handle. Title verification helps to 
determine if there is a lien on the object that the borrower is requesting a loan on.
