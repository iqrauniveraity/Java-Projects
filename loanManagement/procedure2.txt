The Credit Report

In many cases, the credit report may already be provided for you. The loan officer may have already run this report from the beginning 
before going any further with the loan application process. The loan applicant has consented to have their credit report pulled for 
purposes of evaluating their loan worthiness. If the credit report is not already attached to the loan file, then you'll need to double
 check the application to make sure that they have consented to the credit report check and then pull their credit report. Most of the 
credit reports you pull will be stored electronically in your loan processing software, but if not, print at least 2 copies to attach to
 the loan file.
